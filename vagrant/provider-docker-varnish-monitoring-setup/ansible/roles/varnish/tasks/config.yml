  # handlers are executed in the order they are written in the handlers file, not the order they are notified.
  # If 'reloaded systemd' was written after 'restarted varnish' then this step fails.
  # Because the new systemd service file for varnish won't be seen by systemctl 
  # and it uses the 'default' '/lib/systemd/system/varnish.service' which has a different configuration
  # a 'systemctl daemon-reload' needed in order for systemcyl to use the new service file
